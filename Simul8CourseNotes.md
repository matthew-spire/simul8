# The Simul8 Dev Course

## Season 00 - Introduction

### Lecture 1: Course Introduction

- Live-coded course from start to finish (but not really a finish, just ongoing with additions)
- Season Based
  - 00 - Introduction: Here you will learn about the course and get setup
  - 01 - Minimum Viable Product: We sprint towards our minimum viable product
    - Minimum feature set it has to have before you can take it to market
      - Todo app example &rarr; MVP would be a website where people could add todos and delete todos
    - Way to get something out there into the market as soon as possible so that you can start iterating on it
    - Does not need to be the prettiest, have the biggest feature set, etc. &rarr; need something that does the basic functionality out in the wild
  - 02 - Refactor, Bugfix, Repeat: Post-Launch Development Cycle
    - Switch to this part of the development lifecycle vice adding new features, enhancements, etc.
    - Create a stable product before moving on to make it a better product
      - Listening to customer feedback, developer feedback &rarr; refactor for performance, UI/UX, accessibility, fixing any bugs, etc.
  - 03 - Enhance and Improve: Maitenance cycle: make it Better, Faster, Stronger
    - Iterating and adding features, fleshing out the app, mobile app, (companion) secondary app, etc.
  - Course does not really have an end
- Why does this course exist?
  - Based on author's experiences with numerous other tutorials
    - Tutorials that you see online are not realistic (they know everything beforehand because they have effectively reverse engineered their final product) &rarr; might discourage new developers
    - We will see some of the struggles
  - Part of a (remote) developer team w/ meetings, standups, etc.
- Design on paper &rarr; digital design &rarr; decide what features to implement (put in Trello) &rarr; etc. (coding, deployment, security, ...)
  - Can jump around to portions you are interested in if you want to
- Live coding w/ exercises
  - Will need feedback
