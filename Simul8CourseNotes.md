# The Simul8 Dev Course

## Season 00 - Introduction

### Lecture 1: Course Introduction

- Live-coded course from start to finish (but not really a finish, just ongoing with additions)
- Season Based
  - 00 - Introduction: Here you will learn about the course and get setup
  - 01 - Minimum Viable Product: We sprint towards our minimum viable product
    - Minimum feature set it has to have before you can take it to market
      - Todo app example &rarr; MVP would be a website where people could add todos and delete todos
    - Way to get something out there into the market as soon as possible so that you can start iterating on it
    - Does not need to be the prettiest, have the biggest feature set, etc. &rarr; need something that does the basic functionality out in the wild
  - 02 - Refactor, Bugfix, Repeat: Post-Launch Development Cycle
    - Switch to this part of the development lifecycle vice adding new features, enhancements, etc.
    - Create a stable product before moving on to make it a better product
      - Listening to customer feedback, developer feedback &rarr; refactor for performance, UI/UX, accessibility, fixing any bugs, etc.
  - 03 - Enhance and Improve: Maitenance cycle: make it Better, Faster, Stronger
    - Iterating and adding features, fleshing out the app, mobile app, (companion) secondary app, etc.
  - Course does not really have an end
- Why does this course exist?
  - Based on author's experiences with numerous other tutorials
    - Tutorials that you see online are not realistic (they know everything beforehand because they have effectively reverse engineered their final product) &rarr; might discourage new developers
    - We will see some of the struggles
  - Part of a (remote) developer team w/ meetings, standups, etc.
- Design on paper &rarr; digital design &rarr; decide what features to implement (put in Trello) &rarr; etc. (coding, deployment, security, ...)
  - Can jump around to portions you are interested in if you want to
- Live coding w/ exercises
  - Will need feedback

### Lecture 2: Who is this course for?

- Who is this course for?
  - This is NOT a course for pure beginners
    - Should be ready to assume a Junior JavaScript Developer position
      - Some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript experience
      - If you have never coded before, then this course is probably not right for you
  - Bridge the gap between the "tutorial hell" and the first (software) developer job
  - Aims to give you a taste of what it will be like once you are a working developer by:
    - Going a bit outside the development process w/ meetings, stand-up, etc.
      - Software developers do not just sit at a desk for eight hours and write code
      - Do planning, go to meetings, etc.
      - Originally suppose to be a Slack channel, but instead we are using Microsoft Teams for this part
      - Planned meetings w/ others
        - Will try to group people by time zones
    - Getting you use to the iterative development cycle
      - Will not have a distinct start and end point like most tutorials you see online
      - This course evolves over time and will not have an end in sight
        - Look at Facebook as an example of how an app has changed over time (features added, features removed, etc.)
    - Showing you how a project evolves over time
  - When you get a job as a developer you do not always get to start on a project from the beginning
    - Thrown into an in development or existing app, which requires you to adapt
- Experimental course
  - Live-coded from start to finish
    - Long videos due to format w/ timestamps to find your way around and back
    - Like looking over Tim's shoulder watching him code and coding along w/ him
      - Being part of Tim's team
    - Will need to condense things (eight hours of work) down
      - Will only show a portion of figuring something out when he gets stuck (e.g. 20 minutes of trying to solve the problem out of something that takes much longer), but will let us know how long it took him
    - Every feature, every line of code, etc. will be recorded
      - Cut out some of the Googling, searching, etc., but not all of it
- Course is not for people:
  - Who cannot stand longer videos
  - Who have no JavaScript, HTML, etc. experience
  - Who are not interested in the mundane (emails, meetings, etc.) parts of being a developer
- Course is for people:
  - Actively seeking their first gig as a developer
  - People who got hired as a junior developer, found it overwhelming, and ended up leaving
